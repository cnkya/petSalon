            <p>We are not your average Pet Salon. Our goal is to not only offer gorgeous haircuts, but make it enjoyable for your pet during those service hours. We are a mostly cageless environment but we also provide private playpen areas in case they prefer to be separate. Our appointments are spaced out so your pet can receive our utmost attention. With top-of-the-line products and an array of specially crafted service packages, we are certain to fulfill your pet's wants and needs and leave them barking or chirping for more. For busy owners, we offer an exclusive doggy daycare experience. Set up like a comfy living room and with a limited capacity, we are confident that your fur-baby will feel right at home.</p>
